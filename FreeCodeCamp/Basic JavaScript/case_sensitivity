// In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.
/* Best Practice-> Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names
have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized */
/* Examples:
var someVariable;
var anotherVariableName;
var thisVariableNameIsSoLong; */

// Variable declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Variable assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
