<b> One of the biggest problems with declaring variables with the var keyword is that you can easily overwrite variable declarations</b>

// If you replace var with let in the code above, it results in an error:

let camper = "James";
let camper = "David";

<b> So unlike var, when you use let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once.</b>
